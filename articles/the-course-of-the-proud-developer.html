                <p>The sky was turning dark when I saw the first <em>Internal Server Error</em> (code 500). It was 5PM in the winter&apos;s afternoon and we were close to the release deadline. My heart missed at least two beats while my mouse ran to the reload button: &quot;It may be just a network error, I thought&quot;. But it wasn&apos;t.</p>
<p>That day I was working on an important server side piece of code but now nothing was working anymore. No error messages, no logs. Nothing but a <em>code 505</em>. I went into panic.</p>
<p>Around me everyone was packing up to go home and I thought I could not bother them with an error I made on my own code. I was ashamed: &quot;What they&apos;ll think of me? I will loose my credibility as good developer for sure&quot;. That was my fear and the room seemed to close down all around me. I was choking!</p>
<p>It was the <em>Curse of the Proud Developer</em> kicking in after a long day of coding.</p>
<p>So I started to debug my code from scratch. After going through generic checkpoints, I changed my strategy. I moved to a simple but effective line by line comment and test mode. A damn long and frustrating process. The code went blurry before my eyes.</p>
<p>I remember I was almost sweating under the office lights, my sight narrowed down on my keyboard. I was trying to ignore all the happy people around me, hoping for a miracle to happen. And then the miracle did happen.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to Paddy&apos;s, will you join us?&quot; It was Johan asking me out to the local pub where we hang out with the team every Friday night. &quot;Ehm, I&apos;m kinda stuck with a damn bug, can&apos;t join right now&quot;, my voice was trembling so much I felt ashamed.</p>
<p>Johan came to my desk and we got into in a pair programming session to fix the bug. In a few minutes Vladimir and Maximilian also joined us as well. It was the whole team working together to solve a late <em>WTF</em> before going to the pub to celebrate the past week!</p>
<p>In the end we found the problem and today nobody recall who was to thank for the bug fix, it was a real team work, and it was successful. We really deserved that beer!</p>
<p>Since that <em>Black Friday</em> I faced many other <em>WTF</em> moments but I&apos;ve never wasted another minute trying to get out of it on my own. What a relief, I neither panic, nor choke anymore.</p>
<p>My team is here to help me as I&apos;m here to help them and this is how we overcame the <em>Curse of the Proud Developer</em>!</p>
