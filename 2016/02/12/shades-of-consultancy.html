<div class="post-content">
    <p>I’ve this business for more than fifteen years. I saw things and heard requests that you can barely conceive in your wildest dreams. I’m an IT consultant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the time I’ve said “yes” and that’s why I haven’t made much money yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe one should always push forward to face the next challenge, but sometimes I pause and run a personal retrospective; a <strong>check-up of my career path</strong>, so to speak.</p>

<p>Today I want to share with you a reflection about some stages of <em>“being a consultant”</em> that I have been through:</p>

<h2 id="you-tell-me-what-to-do-and-ill-do-it">1 - you tell me what to do, and I’ll do it</h2>

<p>That’s <em>Phase 1</em>, it’s the magic moment in which <strong>you realize you can use your knowledge to make some money</strong>. You are often a youngster on the edge of high school or something like that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was at my second year of my computer science studies when a friend of a friend 
approached me saying: “so you make websites, uh? I need one. How much do you ask for one?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <em>Phase 1</em> you don’t care much about quality or process, you just swim to stay afloat and get to the end of the task/project. You want to deliver something that works, no matter how.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is called “Junior Consultant (or programmer)” and it’s all about <strong>gathering 
all the knowledge you need to deliver</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Step by step you discover that your knowledge thrived, and you start to have opinions about “how” to solve a problem. The moment you get caught in a religion war on best practices or bad mistakes you realize you are not a Junior anymore.</p>

<h2 id="you-tell-me-what-it-needs-to-be-done-ill-choose-the-best-way-to-do-it-and-ill-do-it">2 - you tell me what it needs to be done, I’ll choose the best way to do it, and I’ll do it</h2>

<p>That’s PhaseII, the longest of my career and the one that had give the worst headaches and highest gratifications. During PhaseII you become a “senior” and people look at you as source of trouble solving tricks.</p>

<p>You are the “go to man” for all the problems that other guys can’t solve, you happily see your paycheck growing up, but not as fast as the responsibilities that are dropped over your shoulders.</p>

<p>If you are a freelancer your phone will ring more than ever before, if you are employed you will be given a phone, and the phone will ring a lot.</p>

<p>In IT a senior takes part into customer meetings to help the business preparing their offers, as well being in charge of the worse bug fixing and infrastructure maintenance. And you should also take the time to help junior guys to develop themselves.</p>

<p>This is a critical phase which can turn in two very different outcomes: one is good and one is not. There is of course a third option.</p>

<p>The “not so good” outcome is that you grow into a management position. I saw this happening quite few times: the guy is skilled but he got no time to develop himself any further, he slowly lower his practical skills but can not be fired because he works with the company since long time. Therefore he becomes a project manager.</p>

<p>That is not a good outcome because management is tough and one should undertake that career only because of a life call.  Management is much like teaching and so far I’ve met few good teacher and less good managers.</p>

<p>The third option is that you just move up into the “senior career ladder” and become a system architect or something like that (there are different roles in different companies).</p>

<p>This is not a bad option and I have considered it for long time. Especially in corporate companies can lead to a big fat paycheck and a lot of bonuses.</p>

<p>The problem I see here is scalability: you will never be able of doing more of a given amount of working hours a day therefore you will quickly reach the limit of your career growth. Since that moment you are exposed to the risk that a younger guy with fresh skills comes into the picture to threaten your position.</p>

<p>I have involuntarly been that you guy once, and I saw what “playing in defending mode” looks like, and I don’t want to end that way.</p>

<p>There is a way out and it had been quite a revelation to me. The way out is professional teaching.</p>

<ol>
  <li>you tell me what it needs to be done, and I’ll coach your team with the necessary knowledge and skills, and they’ll do it</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have read so far you may have already guessed that this is PhaseIII. That’s the though one. Compared to PhaseIII, the others are like taking a short stroll in the park.</p>

<p>Teaching is for me much like sailing: in theory is simple but the sea is always moving around the boat and a swift gust of wind is capable of screw you up.</p>

<p>The good part of Phase 3 is the scalability. You can teach to many guys at the same time and you can charge each of them as you were giving a one to one lesson.</p>

<p>I have taught to single professionists as well as small groups of 4-10 guys. The level of passion and communication skills that you have to pull are almost the same. In my opinion and experience it is even easier with larger groups of people because you can make allies with the stronger members of the group and actually get to split the burden of teaching.</p>

<p>As all of us I didn’t born a teacher. I had to work hard to become a teacher, and I made mistakes and left casualties along the way. My wife Silvia was my first real student as well as a group of Swedish colleagues. Poor guys, they had really helped me learning how to teach more than the other way around.</p>

<p>Theaching is a fine art of listening and understanding what the counterpart is willing to learn. The teacher is not in control of the peace of his own lecture. Contents and tests must be tailored to the needs of your audience.</p>

<p>That is not what they do at normal schools, but this is how I’ve learned so to get the most amount of knowledge transfer per time unit.</p>

<p>Before serving a lecture I try to put it in writing or to produce a presentation out of it as I was to talk at a public conference. This helps me in isolating the key points of the lesson and remove the buzz out of it. It takes time, but remember that you can teach to large groups.</p>

<ol>
  <li>you tell me what it needs to be done, and I’ll show you or your team how to configure/use an appropriate tool/product that solves your problem</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the greatest truth that I’ve learn in life, at least in my IT life, follows: “if a service/product is worth to be done, then probably somebody is already selling it”.</p>

<p>Phase 4 is about to put your knowledge and experience to work with the sole purpose of finding and selecting services or products that solve general problems in a simple of particularly efficient way.</p>

<p>Once you have that you can replace “teaching how to do” with “teaching how to use”.</p>

<p>The matter is very simple. Take the following example: it takes less time to learn how to use Heroku rather than to learn how to set up a custom made deploy mechanism on a self hosted machine. It’s a matter of abstract the real business value of a possible solution.</p>

<p>It is also way more fast and easy to teach how to use an existing product rather how to engineer a solution to a problem that you don’t know yet.</p>

<p>This takes the scalability of teaching to the next  level and makes you able to get more money out of your time or more free time for the same amount of money. But that is much more of a philosophical question. Which kind of person are you? I don’t judge, for me Its good enough to have more with less.</p>

<p>If you take Phase 4 to its full length you may end working as evangelist for one cool company like Heroku or Firefox.</p>

<p>An evangelist spends most of its time traveling from conference to conference and give speeches and demo of a single product. He/she also has a blog and go wide on social media to spread the voice. It is not a bad way to make a living out of if if you are inclined to travel a lot. Probably it is not the best setup if you plan to grow a family.</p>

<p>Anyway this is not yet the end. There is an even better way to use all the knowledge that you grew during Phase 1 and 2.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I identify a repetitive piece of work that many people/companies need to do, and I create a tool/product that solves the problem, and I sell it</li>
</ol>

<p>To date the most exciting way I know to employe my skills is to build a product that other can easily use. The key point is that you build a product once and it can be used by countless people, countless time. Nothing scales better than selling a product.</p>

<p>My real life experience is not yet tied to successful story when it comes to produce money by crafting and selling a product. So far I just enjoy the “making of” and release my creations open source on GitHub.</p>

<p>I’m still learning all the glitches of Phase 5 but I can tell you that it’s all great fun and even if you don’t make money directly you can still charge people to teach them how to use the product you are building. Of course this requires you to build something valuable.</p>

<p>5.5 I understand that and write an article about it, so you can know me and buy my tools/products</p>
